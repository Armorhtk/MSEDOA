## üì∞ News

**[2024.0830]** Model checkpoints and training logs are released!

**[2024.0825]** Code and paper of MSEDOA are released! 


## üí° Methodology 
![](image/model.png) 

For DOA estimation, our designed CNN is mainly obtained based on the modification of basic Sequeeze-and-Excitation network structure. It consists of a convolutional layer, four SE blocks, two pooling layers, and a fully connected layer. The detailed structure is shown in Figure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
**Step1:** create a new conda environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Armorhtk/MSEDOA.git
cd MSEDOA
conda create -n MSEDOA python==3.9.0
conda activate MSEDOA
pip install requestments.txt
```
**Tips:** We test the framework using pytorch=2.4.0, and the CUDA compile version=12.2 Other versions should be also fine but not totally ensured.

**Step2:** Generate simulation data.

If you need to use the same dataset as in the paper, you can download the 3.66GB `data_ongrid_250k` dataset from the [Baidu Cloud Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-sgL2OMtSWRB7eFCq9bPpw?pwd=b17n).

```bash
python data_gen.py 
  --folder_path './data_ongrid_100k' \
  --number_elements 12 \
  --val_num_samples 180000 \ 
  --val_num_samples 20000 \
  --max_targets 3 \
  --snapshot 10 \
  --min_angle -60 \
  --max_angle 60 \
```
The data is stored in the `data_ongrid_100k` folder with two sub-folders `train` and `Val` for the signal and label tensor data under different snrs.


## ‚è≥ Training

```bash
python train.py 
```

Run `train. py` to obtain the best model. 
**Notice:** To reproduce completely consistent results, load the released weights of the best model in `checkpoints` folder and proceed directly to the Evaluation stage

## üîñ Evaluation

**Experiment A:** Testing the DOA estimation performance of the DOAMOE method. The finished program allows you to view the results in the image folder. Set the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to 12 dB. $\theta_1$ ranges from [-60, 55] degrees, and $\theta_2$ is 4.7¬∞ apart from $\theta_1$. Test the performance and error of different DOA estimation methods on the same simulation data.

```bash
python Evaluation_Performance.py 
```
